At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8,000 per semester. It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. Write a program with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5 years. First, use top-down design - start with a sample run with test input and output. Next, start planning and identify the variables (data) you will need. Write the steps of your logic (algorithm). Write Python code.
Letâ€™s break this problem down step by step using top-down design and then implement the solution in Python.

Sample Run (Test Input and Output)
Input:

Current tuition: $8,000 per semester

Annual increase: 3%

Number of years: 5

Output:

Copy
Year 1: $8240.00
Year 2: $8487.20
Year 3: $8741.82
Year 4: $9004.07
Year 5: $9274.19
Planning and Variables
Variables Needed:

current_tuition: The current tuition amount ($8,000).

increase_rate: The annual increase rate (3% or 0.03).

years: The number of years to project (5).

year: A counter for the loop to track the current year.

Steps (Algorithm):

Initialize current_tuition to 8000.

Initialize increase_rate to 0.03.

Loop through each year from 1 to 5:

Calculate the new tuition by multiplying current_tuition by (1 + increase_rate).

Update current_tuition to the new value.

Display the projected tuition for the current year.

Python Code
Hereâ€™s the Python program implementing the logic:

python
Copy
# Initialize variables
current_tuition = 8000  # Starting tuition
increase_rate = 0.03    # 3% annual increase
years = 5               # Number of years to project

# Loop through each year
for year in range(1, years + 1):
    # Calculate the new tuition
    current_tuition *= (1 + increase_rate)
    # Display the projected tuition for the current year
    print(f"Year {year}: ${current_tuition:.2f}")
Explanation of the Code
Initialization:

current_tuition is set to 8000 (the starting tuition).

increase_rate is set to 0.03 (3% annual increase).

years is set to 5 (number of years to project).

Loop:

The for loop runs from 1 to 5 (inclusive) using range(1, years + 1).

Inside the loop:

current_tuition is updated by multiplying it by (1 + increase_rate) to account for the 3% increase.

The result is printed with 2 decimal places using an f-string (:.2f).

Output
When you run the program, the output will be:

Copy
Year 1: $8240.00
Year 2: $8487.20
Year 3: $8741.82
Year 4: $9004.07
Year 5: $9274.19
This program calculates and displays the projected tuition for the next 5 years with a 3% annual increase. Let me know if you have further questions! ðŸ˜Š
